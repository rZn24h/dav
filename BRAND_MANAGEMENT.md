# Brand Management System

## Overview
The brand management system allows administrators to manage car brands in a centralized way. Brands are stored in a global Firestore collection called `brands` and are shared across all administrators.

## Features

### 1. Brand Selection Options
When adding a new car, administrators have two options for selecting a brand:

#### Option A: Choose Existing Brand
- Dropdown populated from the global `brands` collection
- Shows all previously added brands in alphabetical order
- Loading state while brands are being fetched

#### Option B: Add New Brand
- Text input field with "Adaugă" button for entering a new brand name
- Enter key support for quick addition
- Automatic addition to the global `brands` collection
- Duplicate prevention (case-insensitive)
- Visual feedback during addition process

### 2. Validation Rules
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Only one option can be selected at a time
- **Required Selection**: Admin must choose either existing brand or add new brand
- **Required Input**: If adding new brand, the brand name cannot be empty
- **Duplicate Prevention**: New brands are checked against existing ones before saving

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Firestore Collection Structure
```javascript
// brands/{brandId}
{
  name: string,        // Brand name (trimmed)
  createdAt: Date      // Creation timestamp
}
```

#### Security Rules
```javascript
match /brands/{brandId} {
  allow read: if true;                    // Anyone can read brands
  allow create: if request.auth != null;  // Authenticated users can create
  allow update, delete: if false;         // No updates/deletes for now
}
```

#### API Functions
- `getBrands()`: Fetch all brands sorted alphabetically
- `addBrand(brandName)`: Add new brand with duplicate checking
- `checkBrandExists(brandName)`: Check if brand already exists
- `deleteBrand(brandId)`: Delete brand (with usage protection)
- `updateBrand(brandId, newName)`: Update brand name with validation
- `getBrandUsage(brandName)`: Get number of cars using a brand

### 4. User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons and styling for better UX
- **Loading States**: Clear indication when brands are loading
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different scenarios
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when new brands are added
- **Form Reset**: All brand fields are reset after successful submission
- **Brand Counter**: Shows number of available brands
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh of brands list
- **Enter Key Support**: Quick brand addition with Enter key
- **Button States**: Disabled states during loading operations

### 5. Responsive Design
- Works on all screen sizes
- Proper spacing and layout adjustments
- Bootstrap-compatible styling
